# Logo Design Prompts for Z-Image

> **Note:** Z-Image Turbo does not support negative prompts. All constraints must be expressed positively ("sharp edges" not "no blur"). See [fal.ai Z-Image Guide](https://fal.ai/learn/devs/z-image-turbo-prompt-guide).

**Target background:** Dark mode (`#2d2a3a` / dark purple-gray)

## Shared Style Foundation

These elements should be consistent across both logos. Copy this entire block, then append the individual logo section.

```
STYLE: Impossible geometry optical illusion logo, flat vector aesthetic with subtle implied depth, mathematical precision, Penrose and Escher influenced impossible objects, professional software brand mark

GEOMETRY: Sharp angular facets, triangular plane construction, 60-degree and 90-degree angles only, isometric or axonometric perspective, crystalline structure, hard defined edges, geometric precision, polygonal forms, faceted surfaces

RENDERING: Clean vector style, solid color fills, minimal gradients, crisp anti-aliasing, high contrast against dark background, clearly readable at 32px to 512px sizes

COMPOSITION: Centered subject, balanced symmetry or deliberate asymmetry, negative space used intentionally, form reads as unified symbol, works as standalone icon without text

QUALITY: Professional logo design, brand identity quality, scalable vector aesthetic, print-ready clarity, modern technical aesthetic, sophisticated geometry
```

## LevitateOS Logo

**Concept:** An impossible "L" platform that defies gravity and spatial logic

**Symbolism:** Rising above constraints, building on the impossible, transcendent control

### Prompt

```
SUBJECT: The letter L constructed as an impossible geometric object, a Penrose-style paradox structure, the vertical bar and horizontal bar connect in spatially contradictory ways, appears as a stable elevated platform or pedestal that could not exist in real 3D space, architectural impossibility rendered with confidence

STYLE: Impossible geometry optical illusion logo, flat vector aesthetic with subtle implied depth, mathematical precision, Penrose and Escher influenced impossible objects, professional software brand mark

GEOMETRY: Sharp angular facets, triangular plane construction, 60-degree and 90-degree angles only, isometric perspective, crystalline structure, hard defined edges, geometric precision, polygonal forms, faceted surfaces, the L shape emerges from impossible spatial loops

COLORS: Primary facets in deep indigo-purple (#4a3f6b), secondary facets in electric cyan (#5ec4d4), edge highlights and accent planes in pale lavender (#a99fc4), colors have similar saturation creating unified palette, slight metallic or crystalline quality

ENVIRONMENT: Isolated on dark purple-gray background (#2d2a3a), subtle ambient occlusion where planes meet, clean negative space surrounding the form

RENDERING: Clean vector style, solid color fills with flat shading to define planes, crisp defined edges, high contrast against dark background, clearly readable at 32px to 512px sizes

COMPOSITION: Centered, the impossible L fills frame with balanced presence, negative space defines the form as much as the positive, reads as unified symbol

QUALITY: Professional logo design, brand identity quality, scalable vector aesthetic, print-ready clarity, modern technical aesthetic, sophisticated impossible geometry, confident and authoritative presence

## AcornOS Logo

**Concept:** An acorn containing impossible infinite depth within its small form

**Symbolism:** Infinite potential in humble origins, recursive growth, patient power

### Prompt

```
SUBJECT: A stylized acorn constructed as an impossible geometric object, the interior contains more space than the exterior allows, Escher-style impossible depth, the cap and body create contradicting spatial perspectives, a vessel containing infinite recursive potential, geometric seed not organic illustration

STYLE: Impossible geometry optical illusion logo, flat vector aesthetic with subtle implied depth, mathematical precision, Penrose and Escher influenced impossible objects, professional software brand mark

GEOMETRY: Sharp angular facets forming acorn silhouette, triangular plane construction, 60-degree and 90-degree angles only, the cap as geometric lattice or faceted dome, the body as nested angular forms suggesting infinite interior regression, axonometric perspective, hard defined edges, polygonal construction throughout

COLORS: Primary facets in warm bronze-amber (#c4956a), interior depth planes in steel blue (#6b8a9f), edge highlights and cap accents in pale gold (#d4c49a), warm exterior transitioning to cool infinite interior, colors have similar saturation creating unified palette

ENVIRONMENT: Isolated on dark purple-gray background (#2d2a3a), the interior depth visible through impossible window or opening, clean negative space surrounding the form

RENDERING: Clean vector style, solid color fills with flat shading to define planes, crisp defined edges, high contrast against dark background, clearly readable at 32px to 512px sizes

COMPOSITION: Centered, acorn form fills frame with balanced presence, the impossible interior depth draws the eye inward, reads as unified symbol

QUALITY: Professional logo design, brand identity quality, scalable vector aesthetic, print-ready clarity, modern technical aesthetic, sophisticated impossible geometry, humble yet powerful presence

## Technical Settings for Z-Image

```
Steps: 8-12 (start with 9)
Size: 1024x1024 for initial generation
```

---

## After Generation

1. **Light mode variants** - Adjust colors for `#fafaf8` background
2. **Wordmark** - Pair with sharp geometric sans-serif (no rounded fonts)
3. **Test sizes** - Verify readability at 16px, 32px, 48px, 192px, 512px
4. **SVG trace** - Convert to vector for final use
