# Logo Design Prompts for Z-Image

> **Note:** Z-Image Turbo does not support negative prompts. All constraints must be expressed positively. See [fal.ai Z-Image Guide](https://fal.ai/learn/devs/z-image-turbo-prompt-guide).

## Shared Style Foundation

Copy this block, then append the logo-specific section below it.

```
Soft geometry logo, smooth curved surfaces with gentle depth, organic flowing forms, continuous rounded shapes, professional software brand mark with approachable presence

Smooth continuous curves, elliptical and spherical construction, soft rounded edges, fluid organic silhouette, surfaces that flow into each other without hard breaks, gentle undulating contours, pebble-smooth finish

Clean vector style, subtle gradients suggesting volume, soft shadows and highlights, smooth anti-aliased edges, gentle contrast against dark background, scalable silhouette readable at small and large sizes

Centered composition, balanced organic asymmetry, breathing negative space, unified symbol, standalone icon without text, single isolated object with calm presence
```

## LevitateOS Logo

Append to shared foundation:

```
Logo mark of smooth rounded form hovering above its own shadow, visible gap between shape and ground, weightless suspension

Soft tapered silhouette wider at base, continuous curves, reads as unified symbol at small sizes

Deep indigo-purple upper surface, electric cyan glow on underside, pale lavender rim, soft gradients

Dark purple-gray background, diffused shadow below, generous negative space
```

## AcornOS Logo

Append to shared foundation:

```
Stylized acorn as smooth organic form, soft rounded seed shape with gentle cap, compact vessel suggesting hidden potential within, nurturing protective shell enclosing growth, the quiet power of something small containing something vast

Smooth continuous acorn silhouette, cap as softly textured dome with gentle bumps or woven curves, body as plump rounded form with subtle dimple or opening hinting at interior depth, organic asymmetry suggesting natural growth, soft transitions between cap and body

Warm bronze-amber on curved exterior surfaces catching light, steel blue glimpsed through soft aperture suggesting cool interior depth, pale gold highlights on cap texture, warm-to-cool temperature shift from outer shell to inner mystery, unified muted saturation

Isolated on dark purple-gray background, soft shadow grounding the form, interior depth barely visible through rounded opening, the eye drawn inward with curiosity, generous negative space surrounding the compact seed
```

## Usage

**Generating:** Concatenate the shared foundation with one logo-specific section into a single prompt block.

**Post-processing:**
- Create light mode variants by adjusting colors for light backgrounds
- Pair with sharp geometric sans-serif typeface for wordmark
- Test silhouette readability at favicon and display sizes
- Trace to vector SVG for final production use
